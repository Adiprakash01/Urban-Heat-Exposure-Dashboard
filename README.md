1. Global Urban Heat Exposure Dashboard



This project presents an interactive \*\*Streamlit-based geospatial dashboard\*\* for analyzing \*\*urban heat exposure across global cities\*\* using satellite-based climate data from the \*\*NASA POWER API (2024–2025)\*\*.



The dashboard integrates time-series analysis, spatial visualization, and statistical distribution plots to study urban temperature patterns and relative heat exposure.



2\. Project Overview



Urban heat exposure is an important indicator of climate stress in rapidly urbanizing regions. This project explores daily near-surface air temperature patterns across multiple cities to understand temporal trends, spatial differences, and seasonal behavior of urban heat.



The analysis combines:

\- Time-series trends

\- Heat Exposure Index (relative metric)

\- Spatial heat maps

\- Distribution and seasonal contribution analysis



3\. Cities Covered



\- Mumbai, India  

\- Dubai, United Arab Emirates  

\- Singapore  

\- London, United Kingdom  

\- New York, United States  

\- Sydney, Australia  



4\. Key Features



\- City-wise daily temperature trend analysis  

\- Heat Exposure Index (temperature deviation from city mean)  

\- Global spatial heat map with mini-map context  

\- Box plots, histograms, and pie charts for distribution analysis  

\- Heat ranking table across cities  



5\. Technologies Used



\- Python  

\- Pandas  

\- Matplotlib  

\- Folium  

\- Streamlit  



6\. Dataset

\- Data source  

\- Temporal and geographic coverage  

\- Variables  

\- Cleaning steps  

\- Limitations
